/*
** This function reallocates old_size bytes of the memory pointed to by ptr to a
** new memory block of the size defined by new_size, freeing the old memory
** block.
**
** If a null pointer is passed, or if new_size is 0, or if new_size is less than
** old_size, a null pointer will be returned and the old memory will not be
** freed.
**
** If the memory allocation fails, a null pointer will be returned and the old
** memory will not be freed.
**
** If old_size is 0, this function will just act the same as ft_calloc and
** reserve new_size bytes of memory.
**
** If old_size > 0, then this function will use memcpy, which is not safe if dst
** and src overlap, to copy the data from ptr to the corresponding bytes of the
** new memory. The old memory will then be freed.
**
** Remember the size of an array is not the same as the number of elements in
** it. An array of four integers is 4 * sizeof(int) = 16 bytes. You need to
** specify the SIZE IN BYTES of your old and new arrays, NOT the number of
** elements.
**
** If memory is successfully allocated, a pointer to the new memory will be
** returned.
