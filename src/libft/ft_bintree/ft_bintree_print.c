** This function prints the node. :)
**
** The algorithm is as follows:
**
** 1. We determine the offset_left position by subtracting the offset from the
**	  horizontal position.
** 2. We move the cursor to offset_left.
** 3. We activate the high-intensity bold white text colour.
** 4. We activate the white background colour.
** 5. We print spaces " " from offset_left to offset_right (hpos + offset). That
**	  defines the space occupied by the node in the second to last row in the
**	  window (vpos - 1). This is because we scroll up before launching the print
**	  function and use the bottom row to print the connecting branches.
** 6. We find the number of digits in the node data so that we know how to
**    centre the number. (See below)
** 7. We use the number of digits in the node data (digits) divided by 2 as an
**	  offset to centre the number by moving the cursor to hpos - (digits \ 2)
**	  before printing the number.
** 8. Depending on the node's colour we change the text colour to high-intensity
**	  bold red or black.
** 9. We print the number using good old ft_putnbr. :)
** 10. We reset the colours.
**
** About step 6, I know it's ridiculous. I know it should look like this:
** n = root->data
** digits = 1;
**	while (n /= 10)
**		digits++;
**
** 42 School has banned us from doing assignments in conditional statements and
** limits us to 25 lines per function. So that's why we have to resort to this
** hideous kind of stuff. I'm so sorry. :p

/*
** This recursive function prints a row of tree nodes at the level specified by
** the calling function by spawning clones of itself for each child node in the
** tree until it reaches the originally specified depth, and then printing in
** order from left to right.
**
** To achieve this the function has several sections.
**
** If it receives a null node as root, it simply returns without doing anything.
**
** //OFFSET\\
** Otherwise, we calculate the offset. The offset is the relative distance in
** columns from any node in the current row to its child nodes. For details on
** how it is calculated, see the DEPTH LIMIT EQUATION section of the
** btree_level_order_printer function description. The offset gives us the
** horizontal position on the screen of left and right child nodes when we
** subtract or add it to the current horizontal position (var.hpos). This also
** corresponds to the space that will be occupied by the parent node in its row.
**
** The initial horizontal position is always the the screen width (ws_col) / 2,
** and the hpos indicator is displaced left and right of that position by the
** offset with each subsequent recursive call and level drop.
**
** For each level drop we decrement the var.level variable until it reaches 1,
** at which point we will have dropped down to the level we want to print.
**
** Once we are at the level we want to print (var.level == 1), we print the node
** and the branches below the node.
**
** If we haven't plumbed through the depths of the tree yet to get to the
** level we want to print, we recursively call clones of our function for the
** left and right children of our current node with the following modified
** values:
**
** 1. The level - 1.
** 2. The offset divisor + 1 (the offset divisor is essentially the inverse of
**	  the level).
** 3. For the left child, we pass hpos as left_offset (hpos - offset).
** 4. For the right child, we pass hpos as right_offset. Since we changed hpos
**	  to left_offset for the left child, this is now hpos + (offset * 2).
**
** Since the left is called first, and it will recursively call its left child
** first, all left children finish printing first, then the right children are
** printed. In any case, since the printing is done according to hpos, which is
** passed always as an offset from the parent's hpos, and terminal doesn't seem
** to mind being bombarded with lots of simultaneous write instructions (thanks
** terminal!), we're all good regardless of the order. :)

** The level order section of the binary tree printer first determines the depth
** of the tree it has been passed as root using the ft_bintree_depth function.
** If the user-provided depth limit is 0 or greater than the total tree depth,
** then the printer will try to print up to depth levels. Otherwise, it will try
** to print up to depth_limit levels.
**
** //THE DEPTH LIMIT EQUATION\\
** To determine the printable depth limit we divide the quotient of the total
** column width of the screen by the row at the depth limit and subtract from
** that the quotient of total column width of the screen divided by the row
** after the row at the depth limit. This gives the distance between a node in
** the upper row and a node in the bottom row. If the distance is less than 8
** columns, we consider that there is not enough space between siblings for all
** the children in the bottom row, so we decrement depth_limit by 1 and
** calculate again, until we find a depth_limit that will accommodate all the
** children in all the printed rows.
**
** The easiest way to understand the why of this equation is to imagine a row
** of 100 columns and a tree of depth 2. So, let ws_row = 100 and depth = 2:
**
** ws_row / depth = 50
** ws_row / (depth + 1) = 33
** 50 - 33 = 17.
**
** So for a screen width of 100 columns, '17' is the offset between the node on
** level 1 and its child nodes on level 2, like so:
**
** 0								50									100
** ========================================================================
**					 17-------------50+++++++++++++17
** L1		 		 33				ROOT   		   67
** L2				 LCHILD						   RCHILD
**
** So you can see that the space occupied by the parent is equal to the distance
** between the children.
**
** That leaves 67 - 33 = 34 columns between the middle siblings on level 2.
** If we divide the space evenly between them, they have 17 columns between each
** other per child plus 33 more on the other side until the screen edge to
** display their data. Roomy!
**
** So let's calculate this for a depth 3 tree. Let ws_row = 100 and depth = 3:
**
** ws_row / depth = 33
** ws_row / (depth + 1) = 25
** 33 - 25 = 8.
**
** So for a tree of depth 3, '8' is the offset between the nodes on level 2 and
** their child nodes on level 3, like so:
**
** 0								50									100
** ========================================================================
**					 17-------------50+++++++++++++17
** L1		 08------33++++++08		ROOT   08------67++++++08
** L2		 25		 LCHILD	 41			   59	   RCHILD  75
** L3		 LCHILD	  <16>   RCHILD	 <18>  LCHILD   <16>   RCHILD
**
** That leaves 59 - 41 = 18 columns betweeen cousins on level 3, and about
** 41 - 25 = 16 columns between siblings. So dividing things up fairly, each
** node gets about 8 columns on the left and 8 columns on the right to itself.
**
** Still enough room, but starting to get cramped, so we cut it off here. What
** if we were to continue, though? Let ws_row = 100 and depth = 4:
**
** ws_row / depth = 25
** ws_row / (depth + 1) = 20
** 25 - 20 = 5.
**
** 0								50									100
** ========================================================================
**					 17-------------50+++++++++++++17
** L1		 08------33++++++08		ROOT   08------67++++++08
** L2	 05--25++05	 LC	 05--41++05    05--59++05  RC  05--75++05
** L3	 20	 LC	 30		 36	 RC	 46	   54  LC  64	   70  RC  80
** L4	 LC <10> RC	<06> LC	<10> RC<08>LC <10> RC <06> LC <10> RC

** For a tree of depth 4 or greater with a total screen width of 100 columns,
** the offset will be 5 (less than 8). That leaves just 10 columns between
** siblings, 8 columns between second cousins, and a paltry 6 columns between
** first cousins. Dividing that up fairly, each node will get about 3 - 5
** columns on either side to display data. Many integers should actually still
** fit in this case, but integers with more than 6 digits may be overwritten,
** and things will start looking very messy. So that is why we stop printing
** here. :)
**
** For user comfort we print out the total Tree Depth that we've found. We
** initialize the level counter at 1, the horizontal position in the middle of
** screen, and the divisor (used to calculate the offset of a given level in the
** printing function) at 2 since the first level's offset is screen width / 2.
**
** For each level we want to print, first we scroll up one line to make space
** for the branches we will draw on the line below. Then we fire up
** btree_print_level to print each node in the level.
**
** When we are done printing the level we write a new line to move to the next
** line and increment the level counter. We stop once we've reached depth_limit
** levels of the tree.
**
** If we had to truncate because there wasn't enough screen space to print
** everything the user wanted, we inform the user. If we truncated following the
** user-provided depth limit, we indicate that.

** then it will attempt to print the whole tree.
**
** The tree is printed placing the root at the centre of the screen, and each

** there is no more space on the screen to print new nodes without overwriting,
** at which point the printing will stop and a Truncated Tree message will be

** resolution will lead to more of the tree being printed.
**
** Any node of a tree can be passed as root and printed out to the depth-limit,
** as long as there is space on the screen to accomodate it.
