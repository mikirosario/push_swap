/*
** This iterative balancer function will go up the red-black tree passed as root
** from the node passed as new_node and perform any operations as needed to
** correct violations of the red-black requirements and balance the tree.
**
** The red-black tree always has a black root. Other nodes may be black or red.
** All null nodes (also called 'leaves') are black. A red node may not have a
** red child.
**
** Thus, the while excludes the possibility that the node may be the root, or
** otherwise that the node may be black (if it is, it doesn't matter if its
** parent is black or red), or otherwise (if red) that it's parent may be black
** (if it is, it's okay if the node is red). If that check fails, we enter the
** correction while.
**
** Corrections may involve just changing the colours of the nodes, or may
** require the nodes to be rotated left or right, or both.
**
** There are four different cases for correction, and two different directions
** of rotation in case a rotation is needed.
**
** The cases are, if the node's parent is a left child:
**
** Case 0:	The node is the tree root.
** Case 1:  The node's uncle is red.
** Case 2:  The node's uncle is black, and the node is the parent's right child,
**			so it forms a triangle with the parent and grandparent.
** Case 3:  The node's uncle is black, and the node is the parent's left child,
**			so it forms a line with the parent and grandparent.
**
** If the node's parent is a right child the cases are the same, but with left
** and right switched.
**
** If a rotation is needed, it goes in the opposite direction of the the node's
** direction from the parent. That is, if the node is a right child, a left
** rotation would be needed, and if it is a left child, a right rotation would
** be needed.
**
** First we define the node's parent, grandparent and uncle.
**
** If the node's parent is the grandparent's LEFT child, that determines that
** the uncle *must* be the grandparent's right child. We call this "left_case".
**
** If the node's parent is the grandparent's RIGHT child, that determines that
** the uncle *must* be the grandparent's left child. We call this "right case".
**
** If the uncle is red, it is Case 1.
**
** To correct a violation in Case 1, the node's parent, grandparent and uncle
** are recoloured. The grandparent is coloured red, and the parent and uncle
** black. The node pointer then moves up to the grandparent to check the
** grandparent's compliance with red-black rules after the change.
**
** If the uncle is black, it is either Case 2 or 3. Depending on whether it is
** a left case or right case, we call the left_case and right_case functions,
** respectively, to handle it.
**
** Lastly, if we have emerged from the while, we colour the tree root black, as
** this is obligatory.
**
** Why does this work? I'd by lying if I said I completely understood it. xD But
** it does work, and applying it after an insertion gives you a nice, balanced
** tree. So that's what I do! ;)
