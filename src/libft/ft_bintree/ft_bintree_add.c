/*
** This function inserts a node into a binary tree. If passed a NULL pointer, a
** root node will be created.
**
** In the binary tree all values less than or equal to any node value will be
** stored to the 'left' of that node, and all values greater than any node value
** will be stored to the 'right' of that node (note, 'left' and 'right' here are
** abstractions, not literal orientations). This makes it possible to zero in on
** a value within a set of values more quickly when searching for it by using an
** approximation depending on whether the value is greater than or less than the
** node value being analysed at any given juncture.
**
** To create new nodes in a tree, the function will recursively call itself,
** seeking a path to the nearest value (in an existing node in the tree) to the
** value to be inserted, and store the value in relation to that node. That
** node's right or left pointer will then be set to point to the new node. The
** rest of the recursively called functions will then return the original
** unmodified values of the pointer addresses through which they accessed the
** nodes in the path.
**
** So, for insert(root, 220);
**
**								200
**								 |
**								/ \
**							 100   300
**							 / \   / \
**							 X X 220 X
**
** Now, in a set of four numbers (200, 100, 300, 220), a match for 220 can be
** found from root in just two comparisons (as 220 is greater than 200, as 220
** is less than 300), instead of potentially as many as four (as 220 is not
** equal to 200, as 220 is not equal to 100, as 220 is not equal to 300, as 220
** is equal to 220).
**
** This is more memory-intensive, but saves CPU cycles, which are at a premium
** these days as thermal throttling became a limiting factor on CPU speed at
** least 15 years before quantum uncertainty will become a limiting factor on
** memory density. So as of 2021 we have increasingly memory-dense and
** compute-poor computers. (*grumble grumble*)
