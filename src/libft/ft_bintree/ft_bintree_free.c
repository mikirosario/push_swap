/*
** This is an iterative function for freeing memory used by binary trees. Memory
** is zeroed before freeing. This is CPU-intensive, but memory-light. It can be
** used to free trees that may be too big to free with a recursive function.
**
** The function searches for childless nodes with a bias for left children. When
** a childless node is found its memory is zeored and it is freed, and then the
** next childless node is searched for.
**
** The function works through infanticide. Parents kill their childless
** children. Horrifying, but I couldn't think of a more humane way to do this.
** That's the world of binary trees. -_-
**
** We iterate down the tree with a pointer, starting with left children. If the
** parent finds a left child, it checks whether its child has children. If the
** parent finds a grandchild, it becomes the child, and then we check the
** child's children for children. If the child has no children, the parent
** DELETES its own child. :_( Then it comes back for another round to check its
** other child for children...
**
** Once the parent is childless, it becomes its own parent, and the grim cycle
** continues, until everyone is DEAD. The root_canal performs the final suicide.
** I hope you're happy, Valgrind. :(
